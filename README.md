Hi, my name is Nico! I'm a data scientist helping resolve global health problems and a PhD candidate at University of Strasbourg, National Institute of Applied Sciences ([ICube](https://icube.unistra.fr/en/))

Some of the things I have been working on:

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on some interesting text mining stuff for an upcoming presentation
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in quantum computing, NLP, and bioinspired sensors
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about dynamic vision sensors!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ndouard01@manhattan.edu

âš¡ Fun fact: I co-founded my engineering school's robot-sumo club!
